The project consists of four files named login, quiz, score, and rules, each with its own code that is linked to the others. To execute the code, you need to install Apache NetBeans. 
Then, choose this project, go to the src/quiz/ directory, and you can view all four files.
To start, execute the login code first. Then, enter your name to register for the quiz. Next, go to the rules part, read the rules, and proceed with the test. 
There are 10 questions, and you have 15 seconds to attempt and answer each one.
As soon as the test ends, the score will appear. You can even play again. The admin can change the questions in the quiz.java file if they want, and they can also change the time if they wish.
There is also a lifeline option that deletes two wrong options. This is only applicable for one question.
